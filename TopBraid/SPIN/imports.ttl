  rdfs:comment "Can be used to link an RDF graph (usually the instance of owl:Ontology) with a SPIN library to define constraints. SPIN-aware tools should include the definitions from those libraries for constraint checking. Using such libraries is a simpler alternative than explicitly importing them using owl:imports, because it does not force all the SPIN triples into the RDF model." ;
