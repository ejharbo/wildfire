You can see any health care provider you want to (including a specialist), but your co-payment will be higher if the physician you choose is not a \"preferred provider\", that is, a physician hat the health plan has a contract with.  PPOs will almost always require that you get their approval before entering a hospital. But they are more likely to cover checkups and other preventive medical services than traditional health insurance plans, and most preferred providers will file your claims for you." ;

High-deductible policies cost less, but the user pays routine medical claims using a pre-funded spending account, often with a special debit card provided by a bank or insurance plan. If the balance on this account runs out, the user then pays claims just like under a regular deductible. Users keep any unused balance or \"rollover\" at the end of the year to increase future balances, or to invest for future expenses."^^rdf:HTML ;

The term \"viewpoint\" is adopted from the ISO RM-ODP specifications and its more recent use in enterprise architecture descriptions. The RM-ODP introducesd the concept of viewpoint to describe a system from a particular set of concerns. RM-ODP defines five viewpoints. Together they provide a complete description of a system: enterprise viewpoint, information viewpoint, computational viewpoint, engineering viewpoint, and technology viewpoint.  In VAEM, \"Viewpoint\" is used as a dimension for characterizing an ontology graph.  The viewpoints of an ontology may not always correpsond directly to those of a system but the idea of describing a subject area of interest from distinct viewpoints is still relevant. A viewpoint can be further distinguished by \"aspects\". For example the \"information viewpoint\" of an application can be partitioned into separate graphs for the \"security\", \"operational\" and\"data retention\" aspects."^^rdf:HTML ;
