  edg:description "<span style=\"font-size: small;\">Treating data as an asset and making decisions that benefit the enterprise as a whole takes executive support and a careful balancing of priorities. In addition, the culture of the organization may not be immediately conducive to Data Governance. In many organizations, the concept of a Data Governor is foreign, and all decisions are made by consensus. But Data Governance requires that someone be ultimately both responsible and accountable (two different things) for the decisions about data, and that may well mean that consensus is not reached. Sometimes it gets to the point where you have to make some group unhappy to move forward for the greater good. The executives need to communicate that this is acceptable and expected as part of Data Governance.</span>"^^rdf:HTML ;

Adding tools not only requires funding (for licenses and hardware) but the expenditure of efforts to specify requirements, evaluate vendor proposals, and &nbsp;install and maintain the new tools.

  edg:description "<span style=\"font-size: small;\">It is reasonable to expect that most issues related to data usage and management will be made at the level of the Data Governance Board. On occasion, however, it may be necessary to escalate a decision up to the executive level. This can happen when one or more of the Data Governors refuse to budge on an issue, perhaps advocating a &ldquo;solution&rdquo; that safeguards the data usage by their own business area to the detriment of the enterprise as a whole. As an example, a frontline application (e.g., for writing policies in an insurance company) owned by one business area may be used to capture only the data needed by that area even though it is capable of recording other data needed by other business areas. If the owning Data Governor refuses to have the data collectors take the extra time to record the additional data, then this issue may need to be escalated.</span>"^^rdf:HTML ;
